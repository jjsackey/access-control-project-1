I had 4 variables (a, b, c, d) and 3 functions (publicFunc, contractFunc, privateFunc) defined in SomeContract.

In each AREA (1, 2, 3, and 4), I did the following in my code walk through:
for each variable (a, b, c, and d), I stated the areas in which they can be read (read scope) and which areas they can be modified (write scope)
for each function (publicFunc, contractFunc, and privateFunc), I stated where they can be called.
